"Get Hooked on React!" talk abstract

Description:

Hooks enable implementing stateful components
with functions instead of classes.

The benefits of using hooks include:

* provides easier ways to work with component state and context
* removes the need to understand the `this` keyword
* removes the need to understand what it means to
  bind a function, and when to do it
* supports using "effects" in place of lifecycle methods
  which makes it possible to better organize related code
  such as adding/removing event listeners and
  opening/closing resources
* makes it easier to reuse state logic between multiple components
  than using higher-order components and render props
* improves ability for tooling to optimize code because
  it is easier to optimize functions than classes

This talks covers everything you need to know to
get started using hooks in React function components.
